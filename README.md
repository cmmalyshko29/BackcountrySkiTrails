<h1>Backcountry Skiing Trails of Copper Mountain and Breckenridge, Colorado</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This was a map created for my Temple Cartographic Design class in which we learned the importance of cartographic principles and how to implement them. This is a map of a few backcountry skiing trails Copper Mountain and Breckenridge Mountain region in central Colorado. It will serve as a pocket map that can be used by skiers, hikers, or mountain bikers while navigating the trail system as well (intended) to also be available on a digital app format. The map provides elevation information, resources available along the trails, access to emergency assistance if needed, mountain peaks, and points of interest along the trail. The main focus will be the actual navigational use of the map in order to not get lost in the backcountry but these other data points may also be useful while spending the day on the trails. The data was accessed from powderproject.com, that will provide the GPX file for the trail trajectory and elevation. I also utilized the GIS OSM roads free data, land parcel data from Colorado open data portal, and the Open Street Map layer to find mountain peaks, and other important data points.
