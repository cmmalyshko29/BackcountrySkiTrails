<h1>Backcountry Skiing Trails of Copper Mountain and Breckenridge, Colorado</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Being an avid skier and snowboarder myself, I know the frustration of being deep into a run, whether that be at a large resort or in the backcountry, and wishing you had paid more attention to the map at the peak. The twists and turns of the trails get confusing and there is not always cell service to access the trail maps available on the phone trail apps. It would just be so much easier to be able to have a map conveniently in your pocket in these scenarios. 

That is why I created this map of one of my favorite areas to explore in Colorado, where I have been in this exact scenario. Initially, this map was created for my Temple University Cartographic Design class, in which we learned the importance of cartographic principles and how to implement them. Yet, it has since come in handy in real life once I printed out a pocket version of it. 

It displays a few of my go-to backcountry skiing trails in the Copper Mountain and Breckenridge Mountain region in central Colorado. Not only can this serve as a pocket map for skiing, but these same trails are used year-round for hiking, camping, and mountain biking. It provides elevation information, in the form of contour lines and elevation profiles, so that you can gauge how adventurous to be that day or plan the route you wish to take. This way you are not stuck in a valley and forced to climb a steep trail to return to the peak. It also shows resources available along the trails, like bathrooms, parking, shelters, and ski resort access, proximity to emergency assistance, mountain peaks, and points of interest along the trails. The main focus of this map is the actual navigational use in order to avoid getting lost in the backcountry, but these other data points may also be useful while spending the day on the trails. The data was accessed from powderproject.com, which was provided as GPX file for the trail trajectory and elevation. I also utilized the Open Street Map roads data, land parcel data from Colorado Open Data Portal, and the Open Street Map layer to find mountain peaks, and other important data points.

Each of the trails is listed in the “No Lift Access Backcountry Skiing Trails” legend, which lists the common trail name, length in miles, and rank of trail difficulty. The color-coded trail ranking is the common convention for skiing, green for the easiest beginner trails, blue for the moderate intermediate trails, and black for the hardest advanced trails. In addition to this trail information, the elevation profile plots show the user the peak elevation and how the elevation changes for the length of the trail. In addition to this, each of the ski lifts for both Copper Mountain and Breckinridge are depicted. These require a pass to utilize so the pass type is color-coded for the corresponding resort, green for Epic Pass at Breckinridge and gray for Ikon Pass at Copper. Finally, the popular trail heads are enlarged in the center to gain more insight into parking and trail access.
